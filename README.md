# Cool Word Game (title TBD)

Group Members: Ben Snyder, Daniel Cruz, Theo McGlashan, Susanne Goldstein

 <!-- Project idea: word game! Possibly like 2048 but with words. Could do a speed typing/rhythm game. Could do something like uno but you make words. -->

Current idea: An Uno-like word game using words instead of numbers, also taking inspiration from the word game Ghost. Players take turns placing down letters to form words and are rewarded or penalized for completing those words. We will solidify the details of gameplay once we have a working prototype so we can make sure it's fun. Once we have a basic structure we might add some other elements to make the game more complex. The GUI will be made in Pygame.
